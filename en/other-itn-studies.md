  ## Additional Research Studies Being Conducted by the ITN


  ## Autoimmune Disease Clinical Trials


  [VIB4920 for Active Lupus Nephritis (VIBRANT)](https://www.vibrant-study.org/)

  
  The goal of the VIBRANT trial is to determine if treating lupus nephritis with VIB4920 in addition to standard therapy is more effective than treating lupus nephritis with standard therapy alone.


  [Evaluation of Brentuximab Vedotin for Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (BRAVOS)](https://www.bravos-study.org/)

  
  BRAVOS is a clinical trial evaluating Brentuximab Vendotin treatment for Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis.


  [Targeting IL-15 for the treatment of vitiligo (REVEAL)](http://www.revealstudy.org/)


  The primary goal of the REVEAL study is to determine whether the experimental study medication, AMG 714, can bring back normal color to the skin (repigmentation) in vitiligo.


  [Belimumab and Rituximab for Primary Membranous Nephropathy (REBOOT)](https://www.reboot-study.org/)


  The REBOOT study will test whether a combination of belimumab and rituximab is safe and if this combination is more effective at blocking the immune attack on the kidney in patients with Primary Membranous Neuropathy compared to rituximab alone.


  [Best Available Therapy vs. Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant for MS (BEAT-MS)](http://beat-ms.org/)


  This study is to compare chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) – a type of bone marrow transplantation – to the most effective medicines regularly used to treat relapsing MS


  ## Allergy Clinical Trials


  [Grass Pollen Immunotherapy Plus Dupilumab For Tolerance Induction (GRADUATE)](https://www.hayfeverstudy.org.uk/)


  GRADUATE is a study in the UK that is investigating whether grass allergen immunotherapy plus dupilumab is more effective in treating seasonal hay fever.


  [Vaginal Microbiome Exposure and Immune Responses in C-section Infants (ACTIVATE)](http://www.activatestudy.org/)


  ACTIVATE is a clinical trial investigating the impact of the infant microbiome on allergy development.


  [Follow up of LEAP Participants and Their Families (LEAP Trio)](https://www.immunetolerance.org/studies/follow-leap-participants-and-their-families-leap-trio?view=patients)


  LEAP Trio is a follow-up to the LEAP study of early peanut consumption. LEAP Trio will investigate the durability of tolerance to peanut allergen in LEAP participants at age 12, development of peanut allergy in younger siblings of LEAP participants, and parental characteristics that may impact development of food allergy.


  ## Transplantation Clinical Trials


  [Measuring Allospecific Impact of Belatacept/Carfilzomib Desensitization (ADAPT)](https://www.adapt-study.org/)


  The goal of the ADAPT study is to study whether using two drugs, carfilzomib and belatacept, together can lower the number of plasma cells in “highly sensitized” people on the kidney transplant waiting list.


  [Daratumumab Plus Belatacept Desensitization Trial (ATTAIN)](https://www.immunetolerance.org/studies/daratumumab-plus-belatacept-desensitization-trial-attain)


  The goal of ATTAIN is to study whether using two drugs, daratumumab and belatacept, together can lower the number of plasma cells in “highly sensitized” people on the kidney transplant waiting list.


  [Tolerance by Engaging Antigen During Cellular Homeostasis (TEACH)](https://www.teachstudy.org/)


  TEACH is a clinical trial investigating whether cells from the kidney donor's bone marrow, called mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) will allow kidney transplant recipients to stop immunosuppressive medications.


  [Liver Transplantation with Tregs at MGH and UCSF (LITTMUS)](https://www.littmusstudy.org/)


  LITTMUS is a clinical research study testing a new approach to achieve transplant tolerance using the liver transplant recipient’s own T regulatory cells (Tregs).


  ## Type 1 Diabetes Clinical Trials


  [T1D Extended Study (T1DES)](https://www.t1des.org/)


  T1DES is a clinical study for people with type 1 diabetes who were previously enrolled in an ITN clinical study.
