page-description: The Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) is a collaborative network for clinical research focused on the development of therapeutic approaches for asthma and allergy, autoimmune diseases, type 1 diabetes and solid organ transplantation that lead to immune tolerance. These tolerogenic approaches aim to reprogram the immune system so that disease-causing immune responses are stopped while maintaining the immune system&#039;s ability to combat pathogen infection.

  The [Immune Tolerance Network](http://www.immunetolerance.org/) (ITN) is a collaborative network for clinical research focused on the development of therapeutic approaches for asthma and allergy, autoimmune diseases, type 1 diabetes and solid organ transplantation that lead to immune tolerance. These tolerogenic approaches aim to reprogram the immune system so that disease-causing immune responses are stopped while maintaining the immune system's ability to combat pathogen infection.


  The ITN is funded by a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the National Institutes of Health awarded to the [Benaroya Research Institute](https://www.benaroyaresearch.org/) (Seattle, WA), in partnership with the [University of California San Francisco](http://www.ucsf.edu/) and the [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/).


  The ITN develops, funds and conducts mechanistic, laboratory-based studies in conjunction with clinical trials through collaborations with academic, governmental and industry researchers. For more information about the ITN and other clinical trials, please visit [immunetolerance.org](http://www.immunetolerance.org/).
