  The goal of this study is to see how the experimental study drug, *VIB4920*, affects control of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).


  ## About Study Drug


  *VIB4920* is a bioengineered protein that works by blocking certain cells of the immune system from attacking one’s own body, including joints. This may result in your RA becoming less active or even inactive. In an early phase trial, *VIB4920* was found to be safe, tolerable, and effective in reducing joint pain and swelling in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. *VIB4920* is currently being studied in other trials. *VIB4920* is considered an experimental treatment because it has not been approved for use in RA or other diseases at this time.


  *A Phase 1b Study of MEDI4920 in Participants With Adult-onset Rheumatoid Arthritis ([NCT02780388](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT02780388?term=vib4920&cond=ra&draw=2)), results published in [Science Translational Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31019027/).


  ## Participating in the CONTROL-RA Study


  There are three treatment groups in this study. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following: 

  * The study drug, *VIB4920*, added to their current treatment with etanercept (Enbrel®) or adalimumab (Humira®)

  * A placebo, which is an inactive substance made to look like the study drug, added to their current treatment with etanercept or adalimumab

  * The study the study drug, *VIB4920*, and stopping their current treatment with etanercept or adalimumab


  You cannot choose your group. A computer randomly picks who will be in each group.


  ## CONTROL-RA is a 40-week research study
