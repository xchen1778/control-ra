  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease affecting up to 1% of the population. This disease results when the body’s own immune system attacks the body, especially the joints, resulting in joint pain, stiffness and swelling. RA can also affect the lungs, heart, eyes and bones. Persistent joint inflammation can damage joints, decrease one’s daily activities in the home, work, leisure time, and quality of life. 


  Treatment for RA usually involves drugs designed to block the immune system’s attack of the joints. Some drugs that are currently used to treat RA are called disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Some examples of DMARDS are methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, and sulfasalazine. Other drugs used to treat RA are called biologics. Some examples of biologics are etanercept (Enbrel®) and adalimumab (Humira®). RA patients often require combinations of these drugs to control the disease. 


  These medications may only provide relief for a short time and usually do not cure the disease. Research is needed to find a more effective treatment for RA that stops the progression and provides long-term control of the disease.


  In CONTROL-RA, we want to see if the investigational drug, *VIB4920*, will reduce joint pain and swelling from RA.
